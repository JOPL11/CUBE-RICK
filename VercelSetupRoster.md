Haha, let's keep this r3f/Next.js madness going! To deploy your Next.js app (with or without React Three Fiber) directly from VSCode to your Vercel domain, here's the quick and dirty guide:
Deploying to Vercel from VSCode

    Make sure you're logged into Vercel in your terminal
    Run:
    bash

npx vercel login

(Follow the prompts to authenticate.)

Link your project (if not already linked)
Inside your project root, run:
bash

npx vercel link

    If you already have a Vercel project, select it.

    If not, it‚Äôll create a new one.

Deploy!
Just run:
bash

    npx vercel --prod

        --prod deploys to production (your live domain).

        Without it, you get a preview deployment.

Bonus Pro Tips

    Auto-deploy on Git push?
    If you connect your GitHub/GitLab repo to Vercel, it‚Äôll auto-deploy when you push. No need to manually run vercel every time.

    Want to just test before going live?
    Run:
    bash

npx vercel

(No --prod flag = preview URL.)

Troubleshooting?

    If vercel command isn‚Äôt found, install it globally:
    bash

        npm install -g vercel

        If you get build errors, check your next.config.js (especially if using R3F + SSR).

Let me know if Vercel throws hands and I‚Äôll help you knock it out. üöÄüî•
What about if I only want to upload two files and a folder? I dont need to upload my videos again all the time?

Ah, I feel you! Uploading everything on every deploy is a pain, especially when you just tweaked a couple of files. Vercel doesn‚Äôt support partial uploads directly, but here‚Äôs how you can minimize unnecessary uploads and optimize your workflow:
Option 1: Ignore Large Files with .vercelignore

    Create a .vercelignore file in your project root (works like .gitignore).

    Add files/folders you don‚Äôt want to upload (e.g., videos, heavy assets):
    plaintext

    /public/videos/*
    /large-assets/
    node_modules/

    Now, when you run vercel or vercel --prod, it‚Äôll skip those files.

Pros:
‚úÖ Simple, no extra setup.
‚úÖ Works for most static assets.

Cons:
‚ùå If you do update a video/asset, you‚Äôll need to remove it from .vercelignore temporarily.
